## Scratch Project

[Scratch Project.html](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23063186/Scratch.Project.html)

**What I built:**

**What I learned:**

* How to use if–else conditions to check the winner
* The importance of using variables and lists to keep track of turns (X or O)
* How to make the game interactive with clicks and costumes
* The basics of algorithmic thinking, because I had to plan out all winning possibilities

This project helped me improve both my problem-solving skills and my ability to organize Scratch blocks efficiently.

## TicTacToe – SwiftUI Code

```swift
