Here are some projects. I’ll add repos, screenshots, and write-ups.

### Sample Project
- **What I built:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Rm_oKNtZt1SmPkFUtUKeTnwOsrUs-xg/view?usp=sharing
- **What I learned:** - How to use **if–else conditions** to check the winner.  
- The importance of using **variables and lists** to keep track of turns (X or O).  
- How to make the game **interactive** with clicks and costumes.  
- The basics of **algorithmic thinking**, because I had to plan out all winning possibilities.  

This project helped me improve both my problem-solving skills and my ability to organize Scratch blocks efficiently.
