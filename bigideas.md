Big Idea 2 – Reflection Essays (2.1–2.4)

This folder includes my short reflections for Big Idea 2.
Each one has the main idea, one example, and a thought or question I had.
I wrote them in my own words based on the AP Daily videos.

---

2.1 – Binary Numbers  
Main idea: All computer data is stored and processed using 0s and 1s.  
Example: A photo or letter is saved as binary code.  
Reflection: It’s interesting how such simple numbers create everything we see on screens. I still wonder how computers handle really large binary values without errors.

---

2.2 – Data Compression  
Main idea: Compression makes data smaller by removing repeated or less important information.  
Example: MP3 and JPEG files use lossy compression to save space.  
Reflection: I learned how compression keeps computers fast and efficient. It made me think about how much data we waste every day without realizing it.

---

2.3 – Extracting Information from Data  
Main idea: Data can be analyzed and visualized to find patterns or trends.  
Example: A health app tracks steps and shows daily or weekly graphs.  
Reflection: I found it cool how visualization helps people make sense of data. It made me wonder how we can make graphs more accurate or less misleading.

2.4 – Using Programs with Data  
Main idea: Programs collect and process data to make decisions or solve problems.  
Example: Netflix and YouTube recommend videos based on user data.  
Reflection: I realized how powerful algorithms are for predicting what we like, but I also wonder how much personal data these programs really know about us.

README Summary  
This reflection covers Big Idea 2 topics: Binary Numbers, Data Compression, Extracting Information, and Using Programs with Data.  
The topic I found most interesting was Data Compression because it connects computer science to real world problems like storage and speed.  
Overall, I learned how data drives everything in computing.
Collaborating
We shared ideas and helped each other when coding. Everyone took part, and we worked as a team to solve problems and improve the project together.



Big İdea 1
Program Design & Development
We started with a simple plan, decided what each part of the program should do, and tested every step. Using print statements helped us check if the code worked correctly.

Program Function & Purpose
Our goal was to make a clear, useful program that anyone could understand. We thought about how users would interact with it and organized the code to make it simple and logical.

Finding & Fixing Mistakes
We tested different cases, found errors like wrong inputs or logic problems, and fixed them by checking conditions and improving the structure. Each mistake helped us learn and make the program stronger.
