Big Idea 2 – Reflection Essays (2.1–2.4)

This folder includes my short reflections for Big Idea 2.
Each one has the main idea, one example, and a thought or question I had.
I wrote them in my own words based on the AP Daily videos.

2.1 – Binary Numbers  
Main idea: All computer data is stored and processed using 0s and 1s.  
Example: A photo or letter is saved as binary code.  
Reflection: It’s interesting how such simple numbers create everything we see on screens. I still wonder how computers handle really large binary values without errors.

2.2 – Data Compression  
Main idea: Compression makes data smaller by removing repeated or less important information.  
Example: MP3 and JPEG files use lossy compression to save space.  
Reflection: I learned how compression keeps computers fast and efficient. It made me think about how much data we waste every day without realizing it.

2.3 – Extracting Information from Data  
Main idea: Data can be analyzed and visualized to find patterns or trends.  
Example: A health app tracks steps and shows daily or weekly graphs.  
Reflection: I found it cool how visualization helps people make sense of data. It made me wonder how we can make graphs more accurate or less misleading.

2.4 – Using Programs with Data  
Main idea: Programs collect and process data to make decisions or solve problems.  
Example: Netflix and YouTube recommend videos based on user data.  
Reflection: I realized how powerful algorithms are for predicting what we like, but I also wonder how much personal data these programs really know about us.

README Summary  
This reflection covers Big Idea 2 topics: Binary Numbers, Data Compression, Extracting Information, and Using Programs with Data.  
The topic I found most interesting was Data Compression because it connects computer science to real world problems like storage and speed.  
Overall, I learned how data drives everything in computing.
