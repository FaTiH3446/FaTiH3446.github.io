<div class="big-text">

- I chose this theme because it is simple and practical, making it easy to focus on how the program logic works.
- I learned that lists allow me to store multiple values in one variable and use loops to process them efficiently.
- If the list had more items, the program would still work the same, but loops would be even more useful to handle the data automatically.
