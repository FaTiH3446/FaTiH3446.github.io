This website is created as part of my Computer Science Principles course. It showcases my projects, assignments, and explorations in computing, programming, and problem-solving. The goal is to share what Iâ€™ve learned and demonstrate how computer science connects to the real world.

Overflow:
It happens when I add more than 5 scoops. The cone resets to empty, just like a computer counter starting over after reaching its limit.

Abstraction:
The cone is like memory, and each scoop is stored data. It shows how storage works in a simple way.

Binary & Compression:
I learned that binary has limits and can overflow. Compression helps save space, just like using bits efficiently.
