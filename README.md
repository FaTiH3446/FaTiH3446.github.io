This website is created as part of my Computer Science Principles course. It showcases my projects, assignments, and explorations in computing, programming, and problem-solving. The goal is to share what I‚Äôve learned and demonstrate how computer science connects to the real world.
a
Overflow:
It happens when I add more than 5 scoops. The cone resets to empty, just like a computer counter starting over after reaching its limit.

Abstraction:
The cone is like memory, and each scoop is stored data. It shows how storage works in a simple way.

Binary & Compression:
I learned that binary has limits and can overflow. Compression helps save space, just like using bits efficiently.
# Clock Game ‚Äì Frog Escape Edition

**By:** Fatih Mehmethan Eren  

**How to play:**  
Tap Start, move the frog üê∏ using Left and Right to reach the green goal zone before time runs out. Avoid the red obstacles.

**Hardest part:**  
Keeping the timer and the obstacle movement synchronized correctly.

**How I used if, for, and functions:**  
- `if` controls time up, collisions, and level transitions  
- `for` loops move and spawn obstacles  
- functions like `startLevel()`, `nextLevel()`, and `overflowReset()` keep the code organized  

**Overflow behavior:**  
When the timer hits 0, the game resets the level and restarts the countdown.
