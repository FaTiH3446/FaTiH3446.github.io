## Documentation: Tic-Tac-Toe in Scratch

**Project:** Tic-Tac-Toe (XOX) Game  
**Tool:** Scratch  

### What I Did
- Made a 3x3 board.  
- Added turns for X and O.  
- Used if–else blocks to check the winner.  
- Showed a message when the game ends.  

### Challenges
- Making sure the same square can’t be clicked twice.  
- Checking all win conditions correctly.  

### Help
I followed a **YouTube video tutorial** to make this project.  
For writing this documentation, I also used **ChatGPT once**.
