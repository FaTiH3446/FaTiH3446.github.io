- Used if‚Äìelse blocks to check the winner.  
- Showed a message when the game ends.  

### Challenges
- Making sure the same square can‚Äôt be clicked twice.  
- Checking all win conditions correctly.  

### Help
I followed a **YouTube video tutorial** to make this project.  
For writing this documentation, I also used **ChatGPT once**.

## Documentation: Calculator in Python

**Project:** Simple Calculator  
**Tool:** Python (Trinket)  

### What I Did
- Wrote code to take numbers from the user.  
- Added functions for +, -, √ó, √∑.  
- Used if‚Äìelse to choose the operation.  
- Printed the result back to the user.  

### Challenges
- Making sure division works without errors.  
- Handling wrong inputs (like typing letters instead of numbers).  

### Help
I learned this project by watching a **YouTube video tutorial**.  
I also used **ChatGPT once** to get extra explanation and documentation help.

What I Did

Made a 3x3 board.

Added turns for X and O.

Checked the winner with if‚Äìelse logic.

Showed a message when the game ends.

Added a reset button to restart the game.

Challenges

Making sure the same square can‚Äôt be clicked twice.

Checking all win conditions correctly.

Keeping track of the current player.

Help

I followed a YouTube video tutorial to make this project.

I also used ChatGPT once for writing this documentation.
clock V2
In this project, I created an analog clock that looks like Captain America's shield. I improved it by reusing and adjusting parts from my previous clock projects. Tapping the screen changes the minute direction, and after four taps, the hour increases. The + and ‚Äì buttons change the hour, and the Next Minute button moves the minute hand. Double tap resets the clock to 0:00. The background color changes based on the time. The program responds to user interactions like taps and button presses, which shows event-driven programming.
